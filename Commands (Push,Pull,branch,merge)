# Git branching and merging:-
-----------------------------------
1. All the origin files are stored in master branch.
2. These same files are copied to a new branch and then changes are made in that branch.
3. After making changes, the new branch is merged with the master branch.
4. The changes are highlighted in the master branch after merging.
5. The new branch is then no longer required and is deleted from both local and remote using two different git commands.

git push -f origin master             (original files pushed to master)
git branch new_branch1                (new branch created)
git checkout new_branch1              (moved to new branch. original files present in this branch)
git push -f origin new_branch1        (hint: done after changes are made. changed files pushed to this branch)
git merge new_branch1                 (hint: be in master and use this command)
git push -f origin master             (changed files pushed to master)
git branch -d new_branch1             (delete new_branch1 from local)
git push origin --delete new_branch1  (delete new_branch1 from remote ,that is, git )
